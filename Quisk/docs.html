<a id="Welcome"></a>
Welcome to QUISK (February 2014)
</h1>

<p>
This is Quisk, a Software Defined Radio (SDR). You supply an antenna,
a complex (I/Q) mixer to convert radio spectrum to a low IF, and send
that IF to the left and right inputs of the sound card in your
computer.
The Quisk software will read the sound card data, tune it, filter it,
demodulate it, and send the audio to headphones or speakers.
Quisk has a microphone input and a key input so it can operate as a
complete transceiver. Quisk works with this hardware:
</p>

<ul>
<li>SoftRock connected to the sound card</li>
<li>Many other SDR's connected to the sound card</li>
<li>SDR-IQ connected by USB</li>
<li>N2ADR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP</li>
<li>HiQSDR hardware connected by Ethernet and IP</li>
<li>Quisk can be used as a pan adapter, and can control some radios</li>
</ul>

Quisk is small and simple, and has been designed so that it is easy to
change Quisk to suit your own hardware. Quisk rhymes with
"brisk", and is QSK plus a few letters to make it
easier to pronounce. QSK is a Q signal meaning full breakin CW
operation,
and Quisk has been designed for low latency. Quisk includes an input
keying signal that can mute the audio and substitute a sidetone.
<br>

<br>
Please read the file <a href="CHANGELOG.txt">CHANGELOG.txt</a>
for changes.
<br>

<br>
When running Quisk for the first time, please press the "Help"
button on the lower right.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>
<br>
Quisk is registered on <a href="http://pypi.python.org">http://pypi.python.org</a>;
just search for "quisk" to see the latest version and the download URL. The download page is <a href="http://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/index.html">http://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/index.html</a>.
There will be a
source
distribution (a tar.gz file) and a binary Windows version (msi
installer). The Linux version is for 32-bit Linux. If you
get the message "wrong ELF class", you have 64-bit Linux, and you must
recompile (use "make"). You
do not need to compile the Windows binary, but you need Python to
run it.
<br>

<br>
You must have Python installed on your computer, preferably version
2.7. Linux almost certainly has Python installed. For
Windows, visit <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>
and download the Windows installer for Python 2.7 to install it.
You must also install the latest wxPython package for your version of
Python from <a href="http://www.wxpython.org">http://www.wxpython.org.</a>
<h3 id="g0.2.1">Linux </h3>
I recommend that you just uncompress and un-tar the tar.gz file
somewhere
under your home directory:
<br>

<br>
gunzip quisk-3.4.4.tar.gz
<br>
tar xf quisk-3.4.4.tar
<br>
# Check directory quisk-3.4.4 before removing the tar file
<br>
rm quisk-3.4.4.tar
<br>
# Perhaps change to a shorter name unless you want multiple versions
<br>
mv quisk-3.4.4 quisk
<br>

<br>
That way all the source for Quisk is available so you can change or add
to
Quisk. If you need to recompile the source, use the "make" command in the quisk
directory.
If there are compile errors or missing *.h files, you must install some
"dev"
packages. See below for needed "dev" packages.
<br>

<br>
Run Quisk using a terminal with the command "python quisk.py". If there
is
any error output, it will appear on the terminal. After testing, you
can
create a panel launcher with the same command but a full path, for
example
"python /home/jim/quisk-3.4.4/quisk.py" or "python
/home/jim/quisk/quisk.py"
if you used the shorter name . Then just click the button to run Quisk.
<br>

<br>
Another way to install Quisk is to change to the superuser (root)
and run "easy_install quisk" or "python setup.py install". If you don't
have easy_install, install
the python-setuptools package (for Debian/Ubuntu). This method installs
Quisk as a package. But you need to be root, and the source is not in a
convenient place; it is in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages. And there
is no uninstall feature.
<br>

<br>
Quisk needs a few additional packages to run. All should be available
as
packages or RPM's so you don't have to compile the source. Generally
you would get the most recent versions rather than the versions I show
below. Needed packages are:
<br>

<br>
<ul>

<li>python2.7, the Python programming language. See <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>.
This
almost certainly is already installed on your Linux. Use the version
you have, or get the most recent version. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>python-wxgtk2.8, the wxPython package used for the GUI. Get the
most
recent version available for your Python version. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>fftw3, the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West. See fftw.org.
This is
a great FFT package and is also used by GNU radio. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>python2.7-dev, fftw3-dev, libasound2-dev, libpulse-dev, portaudio19-dev These
are
development packages that you need so you can change and recompile the
Quisk C-language files. Get the version that corresponds to the
software you have. If you get compiler errors, check for missing "-dev"
packages. </li>
</ul>
<br>
If you want to attach a key status line to your computer, you need to
change is_key_down.c and run "make". I currently use Ethernet to
send key up/down status. I previously sent a 5 volt CMOS signal
to my
parallel port, but new computers often lack a parallel port, and
Ethernet is much easier.
<br>

<br>
If you decide to use the parallel port, you need the ppdev Linux
driver.
To load it on boot, add it to /etc/modules (on Debian). The permissions
on the port (on Debian) are 660, group "lp". So add yourself to the
"lp"
group. Otherwise you will have to run "modprobe ppdev", and run
"chmod 666 /dev/parport0" as root to access the parallel port.
<br>

<br>
Quisk does not use the serial port, but some of the special hardware
files
do. If you need Python serial port support, install pyserial from
package python-serial. Note that many programs use USB, but are based
on a USB to serial converter, and pyserial works with these too.
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.2.2">Windows Installer </h3>
To install Quisk, first install Python and wxPython (see
above). Next download the quisk.msi installer, right click it,
and
select "install". This is best for those who plan to run Quisk,
but not work with the source code. To uninstall Quisk, use the
Control Panel item
Add/Remove Programs. Quisk is installed in the site-packages
folder under the Python 2.7 libraries. This enables Quisk to
be imported as a package by other software.
<br>
<h3 id="g0.2.3">Windows Source </h3>
If you want to see and change the source code, or recompile the
Windows version from source, download the source tarball (the tar.gz
file), uncompress it and extract it into a directory somewhere.
This is the same as the Linux install proceedure. I use the
directory C:/pub/quisk because I synchronize this directory using
SpiderOak on multiple computers. You should probably choose a
directory under C:/Users/my_name with Windows 7, or perhaps a
directory under the Documents folder. You can then run Quisk with
the command "C:\python27\pythonw.exe quisk.py" from the Quisk
directory, the directory where quisk.py is located. You can
create a shortcut on the desktop with this command. There is no
need to recompile unless you change the C language source, as the
needed DLLs are included. You can change any of the Python *.py
files, and there is no need to recompile.
<br>

<br>
To recompile the DLL, install the MinGw compiler and the same
dependencies as the Linux version, and enter "make win". If you
get errors, look for missing *.h files from missing dependencies.
<h3 id="g0.2.4">Quisk Files</h3>
<br>
These are the Quisk files in the distribution:
<br>

<br>
<ul>

<li>quisk.py is the main program and is written in the Python
language.
Python is a powerful but easy to learn language, and I hope you have
fun changing Quisk to make it do what you want. Python is also useful
for general electronics calculations such as complex arithmetic. See
www.python.org. Quisk.py uses the wxPython Python package to make the
screen interface. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>help.html is the help file for quisk. Press the "Help" button. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>_quisk.so is the _quisk extension module for Linux, and _quisk.pyd is the extension module DLL used by Windows.
<br>
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sdriq.so is the extension module needed for the SDR-IQ. It needs
_quisk.so to be available when it starts. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>makefile is the makefile, and you must run "make" to create a new
_quisk.so unless you use a Python installer that creates _quisk.so
itself. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>setup.py is used by makefile and the Python installers. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>quisk_conf_defaults.py is the basic configuration file imported
into
all other configuration files. Read it (but don't change it) to see
what you can change in your own quisk_conf.py. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>quisk_conf_*.py are various Quisk configuration files. Copy one
of them
to your own .quisk_conf.py and edit that file. I may publish new model
files in the future, and you don't want your changes to be overwritten.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>quisk_hardware_*.py are various quisk hardware control programs.
If you
have custom hardware, import one of these files into your
quisk_conf.py. Or copy one of them to your own quisk_hardware.py, edit
that file, and import it in .quisk_conf.py. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>quisk.c, quisk.h are the files for the _quisk extension module
used by
quisk.py. The other C-language files are linked with these to make
_quisk.so and _quisk.pyd.
<br>
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sound.c is the general purpose sound code for all sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sound_portaudio.c is the sound card access code for PortAudio. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sound_pulseaudio.c is the sound card access code for PulseAudio. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sound_alsa.c is the sound card access code for the ALSA drivers.
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sound_directx.c is the sound card access code for DirectX. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>is_key_down.c is the hardware key checker for the PC. I use
Ethernet to
send the key status, but there is code for the parallel port and dummy
code too. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>sdriq.c, sdriq.h are the files that make sdriq.so and support the
SDR-IQ. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>microphone.c reads the microphone audio and sends it to your
hardware
using Ethernet. Change it for other sound access.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>docs.html is Quisk documentation. Look for other *.html and *.txt too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>portaudio.py is a utility program. Run it to list your PortAudio
devices. It is not used by the Quisk program. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Configuration">Configuration</h2>
Quisk does not have a menu to control its operating parameters.
Instead, you must create and edit your own configuration file.
For Linux, the default configuration file name is ".quisk_conf.py" in
your home
directory; that is, "~/.quisk_conf.py". For Windows, the default
configuration file name is quisk_conf.py in your My Documents folder.
<br>
<ul>

<li>Linux config
file:
~/.quisk_conf.py</li>

<li>Windows config file: My Documents/quisk_conf.py
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
To help you get started,
there
are several configuration files included, such as
quisk_conf_model.py
for
sound card, quisk_conf_sdriq.py for SDR-IQ, and quisk_conf_fixed.py for
fixed
VFO such as SoftRock. Do not change any of the quisk_conf_*.py
files. Instead copy one of
these
files (but NOT quisk_conf_defaults.py) to your own config file.
Newer versions of Quisk will not overwrite your personal config file.
<br>

<br>
The file quisk_conf_defaults.py contains all Quisk's parameters.
It is read in first; then your config file is read in and overwrites
some parameters. Do not copy quisk_conf_defaults.py to your
config file. It is too long and is subject
to change with each new version. Instead,
read it
to see what you can change, and then just put the lines that need
changing into
your config file.
<br>

<br>
If you are controlling custom hardware, you will need to specify a
hardware
file in quisk_conf.py. The default is quisk_hardware_model.py. Look at
the
other quisk_hardware_*.py files. For example, quisk_hardware_fixed.py
is for
crystal controlled SoftRock. To use that hardware file, change your
quisk_conf.py to include:
<br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">import quisk_hardware_fixed as
quisk_hardware
<br>
</div>
<br>
There are comments in quisk_conf_model.py showing this change.
If none of the hardware files do exactly what you want, copy one of
them to
your own quisk_hardware.py, edit that file, and include this line in
quisk_conf.py:
<br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">import quisk_hardware
<br>
</div>
<br>
Newer versions of Quisk will not overwrite your
quisk_hardware.py. Your hardware file enables you to customize
Quisk without changing the Quisk program files.
<br>

<br>
Alternatively, you can define a class named "Hardware" in your config
file,
and that class will be used instead of a hardware file. This is
recommended
only for simple hardware needs. The class should start like this:
<br>
<br>

<pre>
from quisk_hardware_model import Hardware as BaseHardware
class Hardware(BaseHardware):
    def __init__(self, app, conf):
        BaseHardware.__init__(self, app, conf)
        # Start your hardware control here.
        # For ideas, see one of the other hardware modules.
</pre>

<br>
Both the config file and your hardware file are written in the Python
language. Python is an easy to learn but powerful computer
language. Quisk can be adapted to different hardware because of
the power of Python.
<br>
<h2 id="SoundCards">Sound Cards </h2>
If you use a sound card for input, the quality of your sound card is
critical;
but you can start with the sound card you have. Check the Graph screen
with no input to see the noise floor. It should be as flat and as low
as
possible,
with no bump near zero Hertz. The 0dB line at the top of the Graph
screen
is the
maximum level, so if your noise floor is at -90 dB, you have that much
dynamic range. The IF (sound) input to the sound card should raise the
noise
floor only slightly to avoid losing dynamic range.
<br>

<br>
The sample rate determines how much of the band you can see on the
screen. My 96 kHz card shows a little over 80 kHz of bandwidth, from
-40 kHz to + 40 kHz centered at the VFO frequency. Generally you
would choose the
highest
rate available to get the most visible bandwidth. Be aware that a card
claiming to work at (say) 192 kHz may in fact play at that rate, but
only capture (record) audio at a lower rate. It is the capture rate
that matters.
Enter only the sample rate you know your raw hardware supports for
capture.
<br>

<br>
If you use the SDR-IQ or other hardware for input, you still need a
sound card for sound output. The quality of this card is not so
important, so try the one you have. Be aware that most sound
cards require the capture and playback rate to be the same when used
for both. Here are some sample configurations:
<br>
<ul>

<li>SoftRock Rx/Tx: Receive to card 1, Transmit to card 1 at the same
rate, radio sound to card 2 at 48 kHz, microphone input from card 2 or
3 at 48 kHz.</li>

<li>SoftRock Rx: Receive to card 1, radio sound to card1 at the same
rate; OR radio sound to card 2 at 48 kHz.</li>

<li>Other: Receive from SDR-IQ or other hardware, radio sound to card
1 at 48 kHz. Add a microphone to card1 at 48 kHz, or to card2 at
48 kHz.</li>

<li>Panadapter: There is no radio sound. Enter a null name ""
for the play device.
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
If you buy a new sound card, make sure you know the
capture (recording) sample rates and the noise level. Sound cards
are usually specified over
the audio range up to 24 kHz or so. But we need low noise and
distortion
over the whole range.
<br>
<h3 id="g0.4.1">Linux Names</h3>
Quisk can use PulseAudio, PortAudio or ALSA to access your sound card.
Names can be a fragment of text from the device description. It is
better to use this text search rather than an index number, because the
index number can change if you plug and unplug USB sound cards.
<br>

<br>
The ALSA drivers use different names for the same sound card
to provide different access. The names "hw:0" and "hw:1" refer
to the raw hardware devices of the first and second sound card.
You should use the raw hardware if possible. If the raw devices don't
work,
use the "plughw" name. The ALSA name can also be a string
name. Here are some ALSA names:
<br>
<pre>"hw:0"		# First sound card
"hw:1"		# Second sound card, etc.
"plughw"	# plug device
"default"	# alsa default device
"alsa:NVidia"	# Search for the name in the alsa device description
</pre>
Alsa names starting with "alsa:" are an extension to the normal alsa
names. They search for the text after the colon in the alsa
device
name. The alsa device names are shown on the config screen.
Or you
can start a terminal window and enter "aplay -l" for a list of play
devices, or "arecord -l" for a list of capture devices. See <a href="http://james.ahlstrom.name/alsa_names.html">alsa_names</a> for
more information.
<br>

<br>
The
PortAudio
interface is newer, may be easier to get working, and may be used to
connect Quisk to other programs (I have not tried this). But for
CW, ALSA
has
lower latency. Run "python portaudio.py" in a terminal window to
see a list of available names, or use
a different PortAudio tool. Here are some PortAudio names:
<br>
<pre>"portaudio:(hw:0,0)"    First sound card.
"portaudio:(hw:1,0)"    Second sound card, etc.
"portaudio:NVidia"      Search for the name in the portaudio device description.
"portaudio#1"           Directly specified index.
"portaudiodefault"      May give poor performance on capture.
</pre>
<h3 id="g0.4.2">Linux Sound Servers </h3>
Newer Linux systems are now shipping with PulseAudio enabled.
PulseAudio is a sound server, a program that takes control of your
sound cards, and controls usage by applications. The idea is that
your applications talk to PulseAudio, and PulseAudio talks to the sound
cards. Another example of a sound server is JACK.
You can control the
sound routing with the pavucontrol program. Remarkably, this is
not included with PulseAudio, and you will need to install the
pavucontrol package first. 
<br>

<br>
Thanks to Philip G. Lee, Quisk now has native support for PulseAudio. 
For PulseAudio devices, use the name "pulse:name" and connect the streams
to your hardware devices using a PulseAudio control program.  The name "pulse"
alone refers to the "default" device.  The PulseAudio names are quite long;
for example "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo".  Look on the screen
Config/Sound to see the device names.  There is a description, a PulseAudio name,
and for ALSA devices, the ALSA name.
Instead of the long PulseAudio name, you can enter a substring of any of these three strings.
An example is:

<pre>
# As seen on the Config/Sound screen:
  CM106 Like Sound Device Analog Stereo
     alsa_output.usb-0d8c_USB_Sound_Device-00-Device.analog-stereo
     USB Sound Device USB Audio (hw:1,0)

# In your config file:
# Use the default pulse device for radio sound:
name_of_sound_play = "pulse"
# Use a PulseAudio name for radio sound:
name_of_sound_play = "pulse:alsa_output.usb-0d8c_USB_Sound_Device-00-Device.analog-stereo"
# Abbreviate the PulseAudio name:
name_of_sound_play = "pulse:alsa_output.usb"
# Another abbreviation:
name_of_sound_play = "pulse:CM106"
</pre>

The PulseAudio code should not cause problems, but I am not sure what happens if PulseAudio is not
installed, or if you replace it with JACK.  This config file option will turn off all but directly
entered "pulse:" names:
<pre>
show_pulse_audio_devices = False
</pre>


<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.4.3">Linux Problems </h3>

If Quisk appears to run but you get no sound input or output, you
may be having trouble
with your settings. Start Quisk and look at the graph. You should get a
moving
line display. Look at the Config screen. Interrupts should be
increasing and latencies
should fluctuate. If all this looks normal, but you get no sound
output, or you get only
white noise output, then you may need to change your settings with a
mixer program.
<br>

<br>
If you capture data with the sound card (no SDR-IQ) then you need
to set the "capture
device" to the line-in jack, and set the volume of the line-in to 100%.
To play sound,
you need to increase the volume of the playback device. Since a typical
sound card has
ten or twenty controls for all its analog and digital inputs and
outputs, it is a guessing
game to figure out which control to adjust.
<br>

<br>
Basically you start the alsamixer program (use "man alsamixer" first)
and adjust the volume
controls and capture device until Quisk works. It is wise to reduce or
mute unwanted inputs
to avoid adding extra noise.
Quisk does not do this for you. But once you have the controls set,
they will stay the same
and Quisk should keep working until you run another audio program that
changes them.
<br>

<br>
To make Quisk adjust the mixer controls when it starts, you need to
know the control id number.
Run the command "amixer -c 0 contents" (for card zero) and look at the
control ids, names
and values of all your controls. Figure out the control you need to
adjust. For a setable
option (on/off) the control value is one or zero. For a volume it is a
number from 0.0 to
1.0. Make a list of (device_name, numid, value) and add it to
mixer_settings in your
.quisk_conf.py file (see quisk_conf_defaults.py). I don't need to do
this on my computer
except for the microphone input on my second sound card.
<br>

<br>
If you really get stuck, try one of these commands (see the "man"
page):
<br>
<ul>

<li>alsamixer  An ALSA mixer program with a curses interface. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>amixer  A character ALSA mixer. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>aplay  Play sound. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>arecord  Capture sound. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>speaker-test  Play sound to test your speakers. </li>
</ul>
And try to play an audio CD or run some other Linux audio program just
to see that you
have a working sound system.
If you can't get ALSA to work, you could try the PortAudio or PulseAudio interface by
just
changing the sound card names.

<h3 id="g0.4.4">Windows Names</h3>
To see what sound cards you have, use the Control Panel item Sound
Devices. There is a separate list for capture (recording) and
playback devices, and a specified default device for each. The
name of the default device is "Primary". To specify your sound
card name, use either "Primary" or a substring of the device
name. The search is case sensitive.
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="SDRIQ">SDR-IQ as Input </h2>
<br>
Quisk can use an SDR-IQ from RfSpace instead of a sound card for input.
Edit your config file to select the SDR-IQ. Read quisk_conf_defaults.py
to see
what changes you need to make. For Linux, try the USB driver that came with your system first.
If you need a faster driver, install the ft245 Linux USB
driver. See
<a href="http://james.ahlstrom.name/ft245.html">http://james.ahlstrom.name/ft245</a>
for installation instructions. You
still
need a sound card for output. The output is 48 kHz stereo and a high
quality
card is not required. Files that support the SDR-IQ are now in
subdirectory
sdriqpkg.
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="Timing">Timing </h2>
<br>
There are several configuration parameters devoted to tuning; read the
file quisk_conf_defaults.py for documentation. For most users, Quisk
should run fine with the default settings. But if you use Quisk as part
of a QSK CW transmitter, you should reduce latency_millisecs to as low
a
value as possible. This will reduce latency, but increase the
likelihood of clicks and pops due to sound buffer underruns.
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="USBControl">USB Control </h2>
Many radio devices are now controlled through a USB interface. In
many cases, the interface is actually a serial port, and an external or
internal USB to serial converter is used. In other cases, the USB
is native, but requires a custom device driver. In still other
cases, the USB device announces itself as a standard device such as a
sound device or human interface device, and uses a standard operating
system built-in driver.
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.7.1">Linux</h3>
Default USB permissions do not allow a non-root user to write to the
bus. You may find that Quisk will complain about lack of
permission to access the USB. You could test this by running
Quisk as root and seeing if that works; but this is not acceptable
except for testing. To change USB permissions, add a rule to
/etc/udev/rules.d/local.rules (for SoftRock on Debian and Ubuntu) like
this:
<br>

<br>
 SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="16c0" ,
ATTR{idProduct}=="05dc", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout"
<br>

<br>
This changes the USB device permissions to read/write for all users,
and changes the group to the "dialout" group. Default group
permissions are read/write, so if you are in the "dialout" group, you
don't need "MODE"; modify as appropriate. To load the new rule, you can either reboot or on Ubuntu use
<br>

<br>
 sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="CustomHardware">Custom Hardware</h2>
<p>Quisk receives RF using your sound card or your SDR-IQ out of the
box. But if you have
custom hardware such as a VFO or
a transmitter, you need to describe your hardware to Quisk.</p>
First, Quisk has a transmit (Tx) frequency and a receive (Rx)
frequency. The transmit frequency is the one shown in the
frequency display, and shown by the tuning line on the graph and the
waterfall. The Rx frequency is always equal to the Tx frequency
except when the RIT (receiver incremental tuning) button is down or the
Split feature is in use.
The primary frequency in Quisk is the Tx frequency, even when you are
receiving.
<br>

<br>
Quisk has a "VFO" frequency. This is the RF frequency
corresponding to zero Hertz audio frequency, and is the frequency shown
at the center of the
graph display. For a SoftRock or a direct conversion receiver
(Tayloe detector, SDR1000-type hardware, etc.) this really is the VFO
frequency. But consider an AOR AR8600 receiver with a 10.7 MHz IF
output
to a pan adapter. For that case, the VFO is always 10.7 MHz since
that is the center point of the display, and signals at exactly 10.7
MHz are at zero Hertz audio. But to display the correct frequency
within Quisk, the VFO would be the tuning frequency of the AR8600.
<br>

<br>
When Quisk starts, it uses the hardware description in
quisk_hardware_model.py, but this file doesn't do much. It is
mostly useful as a model or starting point. To use a different
hardware
file, first create a custom file such as my_hardware.py. Look at
the various quisk_hardware_*.py for ideas. Then import your file
in your config file:
<br>

<br>
<pre> import my_hardware as quisk_hardware.</pre>
<br>
Suppose you have a crystal controlled SoftRock. A good model
hardware file is quisk_hardware_fixed.py. Copy
quisk_hardware_fixed.py to my_hardware.py, make any changes to
my_hardware.py, and import it in your config file.
<br>

<br>
At my shack, I control an AT-200PC antenna tuner, my SDR-IQ, my filter
boxes and my SSB transceiver (using Ethernet) all with Quisk. Take a
look at my n2adr subdirectory.
<br>

<br>
The quisk_hardware_model.py file shows the basics of hardware control.
There is an open() and close() function called once on startup and
shutdown. The ChangeMode() and ChangeBand() functions are called when
the user changes the mode or band with the corresponding buttons.
The HeartBeat() function is called at about 10 Hz by Quisk. You
can put code there to poll a serial port or to perform other
housekeeping functions (try to be efficient). The two remaining
functions deserve more documentation.
<br>
<h3 id="g0.8.1">ChangeFrequency(self, tune, vfo, source='', band='', event=None)</h3>
Quisk calls the ChangeFrequency() function when the user changes the Tx
frequency with a mouse click on the graph or waterfall, with the entry
box, with the band Up/Down buttons, etc. The "source" is a string
giving the reason for the change:
<br>

<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 896px; height: 190px;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<tbody>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">BtnBand</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;"> A band button was pressed (the
string band is in the band argument)</td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">BtnUpDown</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">The band Up/Down buttons were
pressed</td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">FreqEntry</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">The user entered a frequency in
the
box</td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">MouseBtn1</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Left mouse button was pressed
(for the mouse, "event" is the handler event)
<br>
      </td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">MouseBtn3</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Right mouse button was pressed</td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">MouseMotion</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">The user is dragging with the
left button</td>
    </tr>

<tr>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">MouseWheel</td>
  
<td style="vertical-align: top;">The mouse wheel up/down was used</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Most of the time you will not care about the "source". You just
need to react to the user's action, perhaps by changing the hardware
VFO frequency. It is not necessary to actually make the change
requested. Just
adjust your hardware as required, and return the actual (tune, vfo)
that you want. Quisk will ignore its requested values and use
your actual values instead.
<br>

<br>
For example, suppose you have a crystal controlled SoftRock. The
VFO frequency is fixed at (say) 7.025 MHz. Then when
ChangeFrequency() is called, return (tune, 7025000). This will
fix your VFO frequency to the only one available.
<br>

<br>
Suppose Quisk calls ChangeFrequency() with vfo=7050000 and
tune=7100000, so the tune is 50 kHz above the VFO. Suppose that
is unacceptable because of (say) bandwidth limitations, so you want the
VFO closer to the tune. Set your hardware VFO to 7090000 instead,
and return (tune, 7090000).
<br>

<br>
Suppose Quisk is just controlling a receiver and the audio is
demodulated by the receiver and not by Quisk. Then the center
frequency is always the tuning frequency, and you would set the
receiver frequency to tune, and return (tune,
tune).
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.8.2">ReturnFrequency(self)</h3>
When Quisk starts, it calls ReturnFrequency() to get the initial tune
and VFO. To display an initial frequency, return (tune, vfo) on
the first call.
<br>

<br>
Thereafter, Quisk calls ReturnFrequency() at a 10 Hz rate to poll for
frequency changes. You should almost always return (None, None)
to indicate that the frequencies have not changed since the last time
ReturnFrequency() or ChangeFrequency() was called. Returning
(None, None) is slightly more efficient than returning the actual
frequencies, and thus forcing Quisk to see if its frequencies are out
of date.
<br>

<br>
The only reason to return something other than (None, None) is if your
hardware can change frequency by itself; that is, other than in
response to ChangeFrequency(). For example, if your hardware is a
receiver with a tuning knob, and the user turns the knob, you must
return the new frequencies from ReturnFrequency() or else Quisk will be
unaware of the change.
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="ExtensionPackages">Extension Packages </h2>
Quisk comes with two extension packages. The sdriqpkg package
supports the SDR-IQ hardware by RfSpace. The n2adr package
supports the hardware in my shack. There are other extension
packages available from third parties.
<br>

<br>
All extension packages are directories (folders) in the Quisk root;
that is, in the directory where quisk.py is located. This enables
Quisk to find extension modules, and extension modules to find each
other. You can install in a different place, but you will need to
know what you are doing.
<br>

<br>
Starting with Quisk 3.6 C-language extension modules are not linked
with _quisk.so. Certain symbols from _quisk.so are exported using
the Python CObject or Capsule interface. That simplifies linkage
and eliminates problems with module search paths. See the
documentation in import_quisk_api.c. This change was suggested by
Maitland Bottoms, AA4HS, and he also provided patches.
<br>

<br>
Most Quisk users will not need to write packages to support their
hardware. They will need a config file in
their home directory (or other name with the "-c" or "--config" command
line option). And they may need a custom hardware file that can
be written directly in the config file (for simple cases) or imported
from the file quisk_hardware.py. If you need to import Python
files, they must be on your PYTHONPATH. You could just put them
in the Quisk root (not really recommended). Or you could put them
in a directory somewhere on PYTHONPATH (import sys; print
sys.path). Or you could put them in a directory somewhere and add
that directory to PYTHONPATH in your config file:
<br>

<br>
 import sys
<br>
 sys.path.append('/home/jim/my_python_stuff')
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.9.1">Shared Libraries </h3>

The main Python extension module for Quisk is _quisk.so or _quisk.pyd.
It is a shared
library. To import it, it must be on the Python path. There are other
Python extension modules (shared libraries) for other hardware, for
example,
sdriq.so. Quisk works fine when all these modules are in package
subdirectories. If you want to put them somewhere else, be sure that the Python import mechanism can find them.
<br>

<br>
If you link your sub-packages against _quisk so you can use _quisk functions, be aware that your sub-package must be able
to find
_quisk.so at both compile and run time. You need to follow the Linux rules for searching
for
shared libraries. Try using the "ldd sdriq.so" command to see your
library
dependencies. Also try readelf -d sdriq.so.
<br>

<br>
For Quisk version 3.6 and newer, you should use the Python CObject or
Capsule mechanism instead of using the C linker to access _quisk
functions and data. Quisk will prepare an array of function and
data pointers and transfer them to your sub-module without using the C
linker. Only minimal changes to your sub-module are
required. The SDR-IQ module sdriq.so uses this method, and you
can use it as a model. See the file import_quisk_api.c for
documentation.
<br>
<h3 id="g0.9.2">New Packages </h3>
If you have more complex needs or want to distribute your code more
widely, you need to create a new Quisk package. That is easily
done by modeling your code after the existing packages. To create
a new package you need a subdirectory of the Quisk root to hold it,
perhaps "mypak". Then create these files in mypak:
<br>

<br>
<ul>

<li>__init__.py This file just consists of
the
character "#". Its existence identifies mypak as a Python package.
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>makefile Only needed if
you
have C-language extensions. Copy this file from sdriqpkg/makefile.
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>MANIFEST.in A list of files you want to
distribute in your package. This file often consists of just one
line: include *.c *.h *.py *.txt
*.html
*.so makefile
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>README.txt This file is expected to
be
present.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>setup.py This file
describes
your package. It contains the package name, author, C source
files and compiler options, etc. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html">http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html</a>
and use other packages as examples.
<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
To these files, you add all your Python files, C-language files and any
other files you need. If you have a hardware or widget file, they
should be named quisk_hardware.py and quisk_widgets.py. Longer
names are not needed because you are within a package. You should
include a sample quisk_conf.py too.
<br>

<br>
To compile C-language extensions (if you have any) enter "make".
To import your hardware and widgets files from other modules, use:
<br>

<br>
 from mypak import quisk_hardware
<br>
 from mypak import quisk_widgets
<br>
 from mypak import myext as EXT
<br>

<br>
The setup.py file describes how to build your package. But it is
also used to distribute it. To create a mypak-1.0.tar.gz file in
the "dist" subdirectory, use:
<br>

<br>
 python setup.py sdist
<br>

<br>
You can then put the file on your web page (for example). To make
your package available on PyPi.Python.org, first register with PyPi and
then use:
<br>

<br>
 python setup.py register sdist upload
<br>

<br>
Python supports quite complicated packages; see the distutils
documentation.
<br>

<br>
<h3 id="g0.9.3">Installing Packages </h3>
Your package mypak will run on your machine as is. But when
another user gets mypak-1.0.tar.gz they need to install it.
Basically, they just put it in the Quisk root with the same name as on
your machine. Here is an INSTALL.txt:
<br>

<br>
Unzip and untar this archive at the root of the Quisk directory; that
is, where the file quisk.py is located. In this example, the
archive is named "mypak" and the path to quisk.py is
/home/jim/quisk/quisk.py.
<br>

<br>
 mv mypak-1.0.tar.gz /home/jim/quisk
<br>
 cd /home/jim/quisk
<br>
 gunzip mypak-1.0.tar.gz
<br>
 tar xf mypak-1.0.tar
<br>
 # Make sure that directory mypak-1.0 exists before removing the
archive.
<br>
 rm mypak-1.0.tar  # tar file
is no longer needed
<br>
 mv mypak-1.0 mypak # change to the correct name
<br>

<br>
<h2 id="Digital">Digital Modes </h2>
Quisk has a number of modes "DGT-" to receive and transmit digital
signals. The modes "DGT-U" and "DGT-L" decode the signal as upper
or lower sideband, and send the monophonic audio to the digital sound
device. The mode "DGT-IQ" does not decode the audio; the I/Q
samples are sent directly to the (stereo) digital sound device.
The bandwidth of the digital sideband signals is set with the filter buttons as
usual, and the maximum bandwidth is 20 kilohertz.
<br>

<br>
Digital modes require an external program such as Fldigi to decode the
received
audio and to generate transmit audio. There are two aspects, rig
control and audio transfer. Rig control is needed to synchronize
the transmit frequency between Quisk and Fldigi (or other program) and
to operate the PTT (push to talk). You can control Quisk using
either XML-RPC or Hamlib. For Fldigi, start Quisk and select a
digital mode.
Then start Fldigi and set Fldigi rig control to "Use XMML-RPC".
Now changing the frequency on one program will change the other.
Keying Quisk to key down (however you do that with your hardware) will
set Fldigi to Transmit. Pressing the PTT control in Fldigi will
also press the PTT button in Quisk.
<br>

<br>
Using Hamlib is similar. Set your digital program to Hamlib
control, rig 2, device localhost:4575. This establishes a TCP
connection to Quisk. If
your program does not offer rig 2, please update your Hamlib files for
that program. If your program can not set the TCP port to
localhost:4575, then change the port Quisk uses by adding "hamlib_port
= 4532" to your config file. This is the default port for rig 2.
Hamlib control can be used by
other programs such as logging programs. See <a href="http://james.ahlstrom.name/hamlib.html">http://james.ahlstrom.name/hamlib.html</a> for more information.
<br>

<br>
Please read the file quisk_conf_defaults.py (as usual) to discover the various settings available for digital modes.
<br>

<br>
Quisk has an additional audio input and output for digital
programs. They are named digital_input_name and
digital_output_name. You need to set these names to a sound
device, and then set the Fldigi (or other program) sound card to the
same device. The sound device is not a real sound card; it is
some sort of loopback device, and is only needed because there is no
standard way of sending sound samples between two programs (yet).
The method to use for Quisk is the same as for other programs, and is
on the web. It works for any digital program, not just Fldigi.
<br>

<br>
If you use Windows, you need to purchase Virtual Audio Cable
(VAC). Connect Quisk to one side, and your digital program to the
other. I haven't tried this, so I don't know the device names to
use.
<br>

<br>
If you use Linux, you can use the ALSA loopback device, or use
PortAudio, PulseAudio or Jack to route your audio. The ALSA loopback
device is simple, and works the same as the Windows VAC. First
create the loopback device with the command "modprobe snd-aloop" (you
will need to be root). You can create the loopback device
automatically, but the way to do that depends on your version of
Linux. I just put the modprobe command in /etc/rc.local for my
Ubuntu system. Now you can enter "cat /proc/asound/cards" to
print out your sound cards, and you should see a "Loopback" card
listed. The cards are also shown on the Quisk config
screen. The Loopback card has one side that connects to Quisk and
another side that connects to your digital program. For the Quisk
side use:
<br>

<br>
digital_input_name = "hw:Loopback,0"
<br>
digital_output_name = digital_input_name
<br>
<code>
<br>
</code>Note that the Loopback card is full duplex, and handles both
input and output. For the digital program side, set the input and
output to "Loopback,1". For Fldigi this is in the Audio / Devices
/ PortAudio menu. Your audio is now connected and you
should be able to receive digital signals. Be sure to test your
transmit signal off the air. You may need to reduce power to
improve linearity. I am open to adding support for other digital
programs, especially if you provide information on how to do it.
<br>

<br>
The sample rate for digital_input_name (transmit audio) is fixed at
48000 sps. The sample rate for digital_output_name (received
audio) is the same as the rate sent to your speakers. The
Loopback device adopts the rate of the first program to use it.
So starting Quisk first and your digital program next should
work. Or you may need to set the appropriate rates. It is
probably best to set all sample rates to 48000 sps because the digital
signals are so narrow, and this make them easier to see.
<br>
<code></code>
<h2 id="VNA">Vector Network Analyzer</h2>
If you have my transceiver hardware from 2010 QEX, or the newer HiQSDR
hardware, you can use it as a vector network analyzer by using a
special program. You must be using FPGA firmware version 1.3 or
newer. Run the VNA program with "python quisk_vna.py" or use a
shortcut. The VNA program will not work with SoftRock or other
hardware. The "Help" button explains how to use it, and should
get you started. This VNA program enables you to analyze your
antennas without additional expense.
<br>

<br>
When running in VNA mode the two control bytes [18:20] are the 16-bit
non-zero VNA count "vna_count", the number of data points to
send. This locks the transmit and receive frequency to the
same value. The phases are also equal except for a fixed time
delay, which causes a linear change of phase with frequency. The
starting frequency is the receive frequency (actually phase)
rx_phase. Subsequent points have the transmit phase tx_phase
added to create a frequency scan. Specifically, after each data
point, the tx_phase is added to create the RF output at the next
frequency; then there is a pause of 65 microseconds to allow the
external device under test to stabilize; then 4096 data points are
added together to create the sample; then the sample is added to the
block of data to send by UDP. A sample of zero is sent after the
last data point, and the process repeats. The receiving software
must look for the zero sample that marks the start of a new scan.
The total number of points in the scan is vna_count, and blocks
received with a different length should be rejected.
<br>

<br>
Since the transmit and receive frequency is the same, the data points
are I/Q values at DC; that is, a complex number representing a voltage
and phase.
<br>

<br>
A calibration run must be taken before any data can be obtained.
The calibrations request a scan of data points every 15 killohertz from
zero to 60 megahertz, or a little over 4000 points. These data
are saved so that the scan frequencies can be changed without a new
calibration. For any start and end scan frequency the user
chooses, these saved calibrations are used with linear interpolation.
<br>

<br>
If vna_count is zero, the firmware is operating normally, and not in VNA mode.
