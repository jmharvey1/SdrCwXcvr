This repository contains files used to build the CW transceiver
shown in the YouTube Video at:
https://youtu.be/vxcRsNkiOTE
Some general instructions on how the files are to be used will be found here as well.
Use "SDR 74HC4052_Si5351R2_2020-03-30.zip" found in the Eagle folder, to order a board from a pcb service, like JLCPCB.
Disclaimer: Some folders found here may not be complete. If you think that's preventing you
from being able to use them. Please use the "issues" section or the youtube's comments area 
to describe the problem. Hopefully I will be able to add the missing files.

Note: the "Quisk" folder supports Quisk running on Mint19.1 & Python 2.7. "quiskKW4KDpy3.tar.gz" is for Mint20 / Python 3. To install and run these versions of QUISK, follow the Linux Initial Installation" instuctions found here: 	https://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/docs.html#Welcome
But use the source files found here, inplace of the onse referenced at the QUISK website
